Data Storage in Pandas

Customizable Teams and Years


Background

This proect was created as part of my learning journey in Python, particularly web scraping. My previous data analysis experience has helped me understand what data might be significant if it were to be used for a machine learning project. My love for lacrosse has inspired me to do so as well.
